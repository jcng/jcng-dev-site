        This isn't quite a blog, or a portfolio, or a tutorial site â€” it's a <strong>Digital Garden</strong>. You can think of it as something like a personal wiki, or an online notebook. It's a loose collection of ideas, with no rules about what does or does not belong. Whereas a blog is a chronologically sorted collection of "completed" posts, a digital garden is composed of various connected pieces (of writing or really any other media that can be presented in a browser) in any stage of completeness. Some are scraps of ideas, others are robust projects. You'll also find that there's no particular theme to what's found here.

        I definitely did not come up with this idea myself! I first learned of this in a tweet from <a href="https://twitter.com/Mappletons">Maggie Appleton</a>, who has a great writeup on Digital Gardens if you're interested in the concept: <a href="https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history">A Brief History & Ethos of the Digital Garden</a>.

        See <a href="/about-the-garden">About the Garden</a> for more on my personal reasons for creating this, as well as the nitty gritty of how it's built.
