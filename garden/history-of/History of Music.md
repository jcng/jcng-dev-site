History and music are two things I have a great deal of interest in, but very little actual academic experience with. I find it especially interesting to follow the thread of a genre and how it splits off or converges over time. It's a broad enough topic that I figure it's useful to write it down, rather than have the information be lost as soon as I close the Wikipedia tabs.

Discussions about genre are tricky, espcially online. For the purposes of this writing, I'm more concerned with **etymology** than I am witth **semantics**. To put it antoher way -- this isn't about gatekeeping. We naturally have an inclination to want to categorize things, but I don't think having hard dilineations between genres is a helpful way to think about this.

Before going on, a disclaimer: I'm not a historian by any means, and this is closer to a collection of Wikipedia article summaries than it is to a research paper. That said, I'll of course do my best to present information as accurately as I can!

So, where to start? Starting at "the beginning" makes sense, but that isn't a particularly straightforward thing to do with music. Prehistoric civilizations all around the world developed music on their own, and there's little concensus on why. Some theories are:
- Use as communication, particularly for mating
- To aid in orgnaizing labor
- For religious ceremonies

Delving this far back into the distant past is way more of an undertaking than I'm willing to commit to, so for now I'll dramatically narrow the scope to just the history of Western music. By doing so I definitely do not mean to downplay the history of music across other times and cultures, but it does at least give us a logical starting point: Ancient Greece!
