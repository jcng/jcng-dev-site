History and music are two things I have a great deal of interest in, but very little actual academic experience with. I find it especially interesting to follow the thread of a genre and how it splits off or converges over time. It's a broad enough topic that I figure it's useful to write it down, rather than have the information be lost as soon as I close the Wikipedia tabs.

Discussions about genre are tricky, espcially online. For the purposes of this writing, I'm more concerned with **etymology** than I am witth **semantics**. To put it antoher way -- this isn't about gatekeeping. We naturally have an inclination to want to categorize things, but I don't think having hard dilineations between genres is a helpful way to think about this.

So, where to start?
