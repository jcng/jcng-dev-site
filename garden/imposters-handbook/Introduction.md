# Introduction



## The First Computers
- The natural world operates with the same rules as a computer (cause and effect, consistent patterns, loops)
- **Bernoulli's Weak Law of Large Numbers**: the more you observe the results of a set of seemingly random events, the more the results will converge on some type of relationship or truth
- The first computers were actually humans, who performed calculations in books called "mathematical tables"
	- These were then used for very specific purposes (e.g. navigation)
	- These worked, but were error prone
- **Church-Turing Conjecture**: if the human mind can figure out a solution, a machine can solve it easily
