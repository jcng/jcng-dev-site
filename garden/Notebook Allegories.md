Inspired by the Git Parable
- these are basically just my notes (I am NOT an expert), but formatted in a way that demonstrates the learning pathway I took when seeking to understand the concepts
- hopefully there are people out there who learn the same way I do, and this will benefit them
- audience: self taught devs who find themselves saying, "I feel like I should know this, but I don't know where to start" for various topics
- principles
	- Talk about WHY something exists -- what problem is this technology or idea trying to solve?
	- Give concrete examples of why something is useful
	- Combine analogies and code examples, and have them relate to each other (i.e. the code examples should be "themed" by the analogies)
